** 🧰 My programming Toolbox
 + Zig          .	The ultimate systems-level programming language with an easy to understand and simple syntax.
 + Rust         󱘗.  The trendy but practical language for explicit memory safety perfect for complex and resource intensive programs.
 + Crystal      .	A fun high-level language with Ruby-like syntax designed with the goals concurrency and speed without comprimising on syntax.
 + Scheme       .  A great Lisp-like language for scripting, data manipulation, and embedded in other programs.
 + Haskell      󰲒.  Good for high-level tasks that still require fine-grained control and functional programming.
 + Java         󰬷.  Kotlin is better but I like making Minecraft mods so this has to be here.
